Moreover, performed a cluster analysis on the dataset.

Data Format check
Value check
Exploratory Data Analysis
A few of the visualizaton highlights are: calplot radar2

Cluster Analysis
Various cluster analysis are performed to group and define the cluster profiles of the songs.

Different cluster algorithms performed are:

KMeans clustering
Agglomerative clustering
Affinity Propagation Clustering
BIRCH
DBSCAN
Mini-Batch Kmeans
